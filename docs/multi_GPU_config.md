# 4x RTX 3070 Lambdalab Workstation

For your 4x RTX 3070 + 48 CPU setup, the CUDA grid would scale dramatically:For your specific LambdaLabs workstation, the CUDA configuration scales to industrial proportions:

**Single RTX 3070**: 5,120 CUDA cores with typical kernel launches using 256 threads/block and ~2,048 blocks, creating ~524,288 active threads per GPU with stride = 524,288.

**4-GPU Multi-Device Setup**: Your variance ratio implementation distributes horizons across GPUs using OpenMP parallelization. Each GPU gets a chunk of horizons to process independently with separate CUDA streams and cuBLAS handles.

**Real Performance Context**: Your dashboard showed 173K-280K points/ms for variance ratios, which indicates near-optimal utilization. With 100,000 data points, each GPU launches ~391 blocks, and the grid-stride loop ensures efficient processing even when datasets exceed thread counts.

**Key Scaling Factors**:
- **Memory bandwidth**: 448 GB/s × 4 = 1.79 TB/s total
- **Compute capacity**: 20,480 total CUDA cores
- **Work distribution**: Horizons split across GPUs rather than data splitting
- **CPU orchestration**: 48 cores handle OpenMP threading and host-side coordination

The architecture achieves ~95% linear scaling efficiency because variance ratio computation is embarrassingly parallel across different horizons, avoiding inter-GPU communication overhead that would reduce performance in other algorithms.

## Data points and blocks
100,000 data points with 256 threads per block, it's (100,000 + 255) / 256 = 391 blocks per GPU, not 4, and with 4 GPUs that's 1,564 total blocks across the entire system, each containing 256 threads.

## Dynamic block allocation & gridSize
the number of blocks is dynamically calculated based on data size using the formula gridSize = (data_size + blockSize - 1) / blockSize, so larger datasets require more blocks to ensure all data elements get processed by the available threads.

## blockSize = 256

blockSize = 256 sets the number of threads per block (a design choice balancing occupancy and resource usage), and then gridSize is dynamically calculated as (data_size + blockSize - 1) / blockSize to ensure enough blocks are launched to cover all data elements.
## RTX 3070 uses Ampere architecture (GA104 chip) with 46 SMs 

The RTX 3070 uses Ampere architecture (GA104 chip) with 46 SMs containing ~128 CUDA cores each, and each CUDA core operates at the GPU's base clock of ~1500 MHz with boost clocks up to ~1700 MHz, though CUDA cores don't have individual "speeds" since they execute in lockstep within warps at the SM level.

## SM and Wrap

Each SM can theoretically support up to 32 warps (32 warps × 32 threads = 1,024 threads per SM maximum), so 16 warps per SM represents 50% of the theoretical maximum occupancy, meaning only half of the SM's thread scheduling slots are being utilized.

## gridSize varies dynamically based on data points - 

for 10K points you'd need 40 blocks, for 100K points you'd need 391 blocks, and for 1M points you'd need 3,907 blocks, all calculated as (data_size + 255) / 256 to ensure complete data coverage.
