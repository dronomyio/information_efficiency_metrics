# visualization computeHPeriodReturns kernel

This visualization shows how the `computeHPeriodReturns` kernel efficiently computes overlapping h-period returns using a grid-stride loop pattern.

**Key Components:**

**Grid-Stride Loop**: Each thread processes multiple output elements separated by the total grid size (`stride`). Thread 0 computes h_returns[0] and h_returns[4], Thread 1 handles h_returns[1] and h_returns[5], etc. This pattern ensures work distribution even when the data size exceeds the number of available threads.

**Memory Access Pattern**: The inner loop sums h consecutive elements from the returns array. For h=3, h_returns[0] = r0+r1+r2, h_returns[1] = r1+r2+r3, creating the overlapping windows needed for variance ratio analysis.

**Performance Optimizations**:
- `#pragma unroll 8` hints the compiler to unroll the inner summation loop for better instruction-level parallelism
- `__restrict__` pointers prevent compiler assumptions about memory aliasing
- Sequential memory access ensures coalesced reads from global memory
- Grid-stride pattern maximizes thread utilization and memory locality

The output h_returns array contains (n-h+1) elements, each representing the sum of h consecutive returns starting at different positions. This creates the overlapping h-period returns required for computing variance ratios in your market microstructure analysis.
